# polarspoofer

#### Polar M400 watch spoofer

I wrote this project to fool around with the Polar Flow app. It pretends to be a Polar M400 watch in order
to listen to watch <-> app communication. 

#### Compile

````
cd polarspoofer
xcodebuild
````

#### Run

````
./build/Release/polarspoofer
````

#### Data

This app uses data that can be dumped using either USB or BT LE version of my dumper.
